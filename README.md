## Notes

Because OpenWeatherMap does not provide an Endpoint forecast API that accepts city parameters. So for now the weather forecast data for the next 5 days will display data from the user's location by default and is not affected by the selected saved city.
Google's geoencoding API (paid) is required to convert city names into coordinates that the Endpoint forecast API can accept.

Thank you!
